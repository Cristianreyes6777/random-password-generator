# Creating  random password generator

## Description

In this challenge, we had to create a random password generator. When the random password generator has an event happen, in his case its clicked, we are presented with a series of prompts to answer. We are then able to select different options. We can select length, special characters, numbers, uppercase/lowercase, and other defining factors based on how we want our password generated. The password is then written to our page allowing where we can copy/paste, write it down, etc.


## Installation
